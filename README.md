# Coding Exercise

Create a simple shopping list web application. A user should be able to view the current items on their list, add items, and delete items.

The frontend should be in Angular, and the backend should be .NET Core (or .NET 5/6). The backend should store the shopping list items in a database using Entity Framework Core.

What we're looking for when we review your project:
Does it work?
Were instructions followed?
Is the code clean and well-crafted?
Are standard best practices being followed?
Are project files well-organized?
